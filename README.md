### Photon
This game is written in Javascript using HTML's Canvas for rendering. I like this project because it is my first game I implemented smooth movement

### Final Project (GITA 2)
This game is written in Javascript using HTML's Canvas for rendering. I implemented a lot of autonomous functionality with the enemies / characters, and a click-and-drag mechanism for moving characters around

### Movement

This was a testbench for a library suite I developed, this project showcases smooth movement with diagonal capabilites 

- [Code](./GITA%203/Movement/)

### Projectiles

One of my favorites, this game was the first to use a new math library that I developed to help with multivariable calculus. It allows for easy boilerplate code and also where I implemented my own path following controller (pure pursuit) with self derived equations.

### Final Project (GITA 3)

Probably my most complex game, this was the last project, and therefore most fully fledged version of my math library, that included an updated version of my path following controller as well as an implementation of the A* algorithm that I developed in Javascript. I also implemented an anti-collision algorithm for entities, so that they wouldn't clip into each other.
