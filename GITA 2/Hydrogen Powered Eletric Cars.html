        Hydrogen powered electric cars are similar to all-electric vehicles, except the car 
        produces electricity using a fuel cell powered by hydrogen to run the car, rather 
        than getting electricity from only a battery. The first commercially produced 
        hydrogen powered electric car was the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, which was introduced in 2013. 
        Another popular hydrogen powered electric car is the Toyota Mirai, which was released in 
        2015.

        Hydrogen cars densely pack their energy storage, so they're usually able to drive 
        longer distances than battery powered electric vehicles. While most fully electric 
        vehicles can travel between 100-200 miles on a single charge, hydrogen ones can get 
        to 300 miles. The hydrogen is fed into the fuel cell, which is what generates the 
        electricity. It combines hydrogen and air which generates electricity. Inside the 
        fuel cell is a liquid with a positively charged anode on one side and a negatively 
        charged cathode on the other, like a battery. In the cell, hydrogen atoms split 
        into protons and electrons. This provides the car with the power for the carâ€™s 
        electric motor, and also creates water as an exhaust product. Because hydrogen
        powered electric cars are not very popular currently, there are limited fueling
        stations.

        Toyota is selling the car Mirai, which costs around $50,000. This price point is a 
        little more expensive than a conventional car, but it is much less than hydrogen 
        fuel cells used to cost. For hydrogen and electric cars to cut down on carbon 
        emissions, the electricity used to develop, manufacture, and charge fuel cells also 
        has to come from a source of clean energy. Currently, hydrogen cells to use as fuel 
        are a little pricey, but it is possible for the prices to decrease as they can start 
        being made in bulk, and hydrogen powered electric cars become more popular.
